Königsberg was a city in Prussia that time. The river Pregel flowed through the town, creating two islands. The city and the islands were connected by seven bridges as shown. The inhabitants of the city were moved by the question, if it was possible to take a walk through the town by visiting each area of the town and crossing each bridge only once? Every bridge must have been crossed completely, i.e. it is not allowed to walk halfway onto a bridge and then turn around and later cross the other half from the other side. The walk need not start and end at the same spot. Leonhard Euler solved the problem in 1735 by proving that it is not possible.\n\nHe found out that the choice of a route inside each land area is irrelevant and that the only thing which mattered is the order (or the sequence) in which the bridges are crossed. He had formulated an abstraction of the problem, eliminating unnecessary facts and focussing on the land areas and the bridges connecting them. This way, he created the foundations of graph theory. If we see a \"land area\" as a vertex and each bridge as an edge, we have \"reduced\" the problem to a graph.\n\nIntroduction into Graph Theory Using Python\n\nBefore we start our treatize on possible Python representations of graphs, we want to present some general definitions of graphs and its components.\n\nA \"graph\"1 in mathematics and computer science consists of \"nodes\", also known as \"vertices\". Nodes may or may not be connected with one another. In our illustration, - which is a pictorial representation of a graph,\n\nthe node \"a\" is connected with the node \"c\", but \"a\" is not connected with \"b\". The connecting line between two nodes is called an edge. If the edges between the nodes are undirected, the graph is called an undirected graph. If an edge is directed from one vertex (node) to another, a graph is called a directed graph. An directed edge is called an arc.\nThough graphs may look very theoretical, many practical problems can be represented by graphs. They are often used to model problems or situations in physics, biology, psychology and above all in computer science. In computer science, graphs are used to represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices, the flow of computation,\nIn the latter case, the are used to represent the data organisation, like the file system of an operating system, or communication networks. The link structure of websites can be seen as a graph as well, i.e. a directed graph, because a link is a directed edge or an arc.\nPython has no built-in data type or class for graphs, but it is easy to implement them in Python. One data type is ideal for representing graphs in Python, i.e. dictionaries. The graph in our illustration can be implemented in the following way:\ngraph = { \"a\" : {\"c\"},\n          \"b\" : {\"c\", \"e\"},\n          \"c\" : {\"a\", \"b\", \"d\", \"e\"},\n          \"d\" : {\"c\"},\n          \"e\" : {\"c\", \"b\"},\n          \"f\" : {}\n        }\nThe keys of the dictionary above are the nodes of our graph. The corresponding values are sets with the nodes, which are connectrd by an edge. A set is better than a list or a tuple, because this way, we can have only one edge between two nodes. There is no simpler and more elegant way to represent a graph.\n\nAn edge can also be ideally implemented as a set with two elements, i.e. the end nodes. This is ideal for undirected graphs. For directed graphs we would prefer lists or tuples to implement edges.\n\nFunction to generate the list of all edges:\n\ndef generate_edges(graph):\n    edges = []\n    for node in graph:\n        for neighbour in graph[node]:\n            edges.append({node, neighbour})\n \n    return edges\n \nprint(generate_edges(graph))\nOUTPUT:\n\n[{'c', 'a'}, {'c', 'b'}, {'b', 'e'}, {'c', 'd'}, {'c', 'b'}, {'c', 'e'}, {'c', 'a'}, {'c', 'd'}, {'c', 'e'}, {'b', 'e'}]\nAs we can see, there is no edge containing the node \"f\". \"f\" is an isolated node of our graph. The following Python function calculates the isolated nodes of a given graph:\n\ndef find_isolated_nodes(graph):\n    \"\"\" returns a set of isolated nodes. \"\"\"\n    isolated = set()\n    for node in graph:\n        if not graph[node]:\n            isolated.add(node)\n    return isolated\nIf we call this function with our graph, a list containing \"f\" will be returned: [\"f\"]\n\nGraphs as a Python Class\n\nBefore we go on with writing functions for graphs, we have a first go at a Python graph class implementation.\n\nIf you look at the following listing of our class, you can see in the init-method that we use a dictionary \"self._graph_dict\" for storing the vertices and their corresponding adjacent vertices.\n\n\"\"\" A Python Class\nA simple Python graph class, demonstrating the essential \nfacts and functionalities of graphs.\n\"\"\"\n \n \nclass Graph(object):\n \n    def __init__(self, graph_dict=None):\n        \"\"\" initializes a graph object \n            If no dictionary or None is given, \n            an empty dictionary will be used\n        \"\"\"\n        if graph_dict == None:\n            graph_dict = {}\n        self._graph_dict = graph_dict\n \n    def edges(self, vertice):\n        \"\"\" returns a list of all the edges of a vertice\"\"\"\n        return self._graph_dict[vertice]\n        \n    def all_vertices(self):\n        \"\"\" returns the vertices of a graph as a set \"\"\"\n        return set(self._graph_dict.keys())\n \n    def all_edges(self):\n        \"\"\" returns the edges of a graph \"\"\"\n        return self.__generate_edges()\n \n    def add_vertex(self, vertex):\n        \"\"\" If the vertex \"vertex\" is not in \n            self._graph_dict, a key \"vertex\" with an empty\n            list as a value is added to the dictionary. \n            Otherwise nothing has to be done. \n        \"\"\"\n        if vertex not in self._graph_dict:\n            self._graph_dict[vertex] = []\n \n    def add_edge(self, edge):\n        \"\"\" assumes that edge is of type set, tuple or list; \n            between two vertices can be multiple edges! \n        \"\"\"\n        edge = set(edge)\n        vertex1, vertex2 = tuple(edge)\n        for x, y in [(vertex1, vertex2), (vertex2, vertex1)]:\n            if x in self._graph_dict:\n                self._graph_dict[x].add(y)\n            else:\n                self._graph_dict[x] = [y]\n \n    def __generate_edges(self):\n        \"\"\" A static method generating the edges of the \n            graph \"graph\".

The maximum degree of a graph G, denoted by Δ(G), and the minimum degree of a graph, denoted by δ(G), are the maximum and minimum degree of its vertices.\n\nIn the graph on the right side, the maximum degree is 5 at vertex c and the minimum degree is 0, i.e the isolated vertex f.\n\nIf all the degrees in a graph are the same, the graph is a regular graph.\n\nIn a regular graph, all degrees are the same, and so we can speak of the degree of the graph.\n\nThe degree sum formula (Handshaking lemma):\n\n∑v ∈ Vdeg(v) = 2 |E|\n\nThis means that the sum of degrees of all the vertices is equal to the number of edges multiplied by 2. We can conclude that the number of vertices with odd degree has to be even. This statement is known as the handshaking lemma. The name \"handshaking lemma\" stems from a popular mathematical problem: In any group of people the number of people who have shaken hands with an odd number of other people from the group is even.\n\nThe degree sequence of an undirected graph is defined as the sequence of its vertex degrees in a non-increasing order. The following method returns a tuple with the degree sequence of the instance graph:\n\nWe will design a new class Graph2 now, which inherits from our previously defined graph Graph and we add the following methods to it:\n\nvertex_degree\nfind_isolated_vertices\ndelta\ndegree_sequence\nclass Graph2(Graph):\n    \n    def vertex_degree(self, vertex):\n        \"\"\" The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connecting\n        it, i.e. the number of adjacent vertices.

Note that I edited the file to have text colors correspond to whether they are leaf/terminal nodes or decision nodes using a text editor.\n\nGraphviz is a open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. In data science, one use of Graphviz is to visualize decision trees. I should note that the reason why I am going over Graphviz after covering Matplotlib is that getting this to work can be difficult. The first part of this process involves creating a dot file. A dot file is a Graphviz representation of a decision tree. The problem is that using Graphviz to convert the dot file into an image file (png, jpg, etc) can be difficult. There are a couple ways to do this including: installing python-graphviz though Anaconda, installing Graphviz through Homebrew (Mac), installing Graphviz executables from the official site (Windows), and using an online converter on the contents of your dot file to convert it into an image.\n\nhttps://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*Xn_DATiT0S8RhfkmckGnRA.png","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"26833d7b36be4094af984fe4dd7e11b8","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"7a9ca6c369944dc9a3ff49d53ed215c0","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It is the number of vertices adjacent to a vertex V.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"52dc93b0b86149de84ebcdea11143555","is_collapsed":false,"formattedRanges":[],"deepnote_cell_type":"text-cell-p"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Notation − deg(V).","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"f684953a-3dd4-4427-8e18-b21078c9bd2b","is_collapsed":false,"formattedRanges":[],"deepnote_cell_type":"text-cell-p"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In a simple graph with n number of vertices, the degree of any vertices is −","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"fa1c01c9-a9b1-4e59-834d-1a1e510e83df","is_collapsed":false,"formattedRanges":[],"deepnote_cell_type":"text-cell-p"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"deg(v) = n – 1 ∀ v ∈ G\nA vertex can form an edge with all other vertices except by itself.
